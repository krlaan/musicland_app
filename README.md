# Musicland App in Flutter

Hi, this my new app built in Flutter.

## Idea
Mobile platform for musicians to find collaboration opportunities. Users can create profiles with their instruments, genres, and experience level, and post collaboration ads such as “Looking for a drummer”. Other users can browse these ads and save favorites.  Purpose: provide a user-friendly tool for musicians to connect with each other, find band members.

## Main Users
The target users are musicians of all levels in Estonia who want to connect with other musicians for collaboration. They are amateur and professional musicians and individuals looking for band members. The audience is mainly aged 14–40.

## Backend/Services
The app will use Firebase for backend services: Authentication, Database, Offline Support, Push Notifications. 

## Features
- User Authentication - user registration and login functionality using Firebase. Included proper error handling for login failures
- Data Management - data from an external API or local source, data modification/saving via API calls. Used local database or device storage (SQLite, AsyncStorage, SharedPreferences etc.) for offline functionality. Included proper data validation and error handling.
- User Interface (UI/UX) - Minimum of 5 different screens/views with distinct functionalities. Followed mobile UI/UX best practices and accessibility guidelines. Included proper navigation between screens.
- Technical Architecture and Code Quality - demonstrated modular, well-structured code architecture. Code is readable, commented, and follow established patterns. Included proper error handling throughout the application.
- Push Notifications - users receive alerts when someone expresses interest in their ad.
- Social Login (Google) – login with Google account.
- Other: Filtering ads by instrument or genre, Saving ads to favorites (offline supported)


Thank you!

Kristjan.
